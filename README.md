For our 9th coding camp homework assignment, we were given the task of creating

This fifth coding project gave us the challenge of creating a Daily Planner, used for storing user activities. These inputs were dependent on the chosen time of day and were relative to the actual time. Activities can be chosen and stored locally, even when the page is refreshed. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery were all used in the styling and functionality of the webpage.

## Motivation

I found this project straightforward and somewhat easier to work with than previous activities. My motivation in completing the planner was to continue practicing JavaScript and learn more about JQuery. I also honed previously learned skills on the static contents of the page, increasing my strengths in HTML and CSS. I enjoyed this assignment quite a bit. While it was a time-consuming activity, it was fun to see how far I have come programming in the past two months.

## Features

Homework 5 has a user-friendly layout, projecting the current time on the top in connection with moment.js. Hour slots are given below, allowing the user to input activities they would like to save. These activities can be saved locally with side buttons featuring an on.click event. Input boxes also change their colors depending on the time of day. The user can in live-time enter text in one box at a certain color, and return later the same day to a different set of colors. All-together the Daily Planner is a functional application that connects several programming languages.
